# Tectrid - sculpting SDK
Sculpt engine written when trying to found a startup company which aimed to provide simple modeling tools, to be used by everyone, on all kind of support (web, desktop, VR).<br>
Though I stopped the project, you can find the code here, feel free to use it and modify it.<br>
